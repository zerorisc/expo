    This file is the "auto-generated DIF library header template", which
    provides some mandatory DIFs prototypes, that are similar across all IPs.
    This template is rendered into a .inc file that is included by the semi-
    auto-generated DIF header file (see util/make_new_dif/dif_template.h.tpl).
    Note, since this template is designed to manifest as a non-standalone header
    it has the file extension, .inc.

    For more information, see: https://github.com/lowRISC/opentitan/issues/8142

    Note, this template requires the following Python objects to be passed:

    1. ip: See util/make_new_dif.py for the definition of the `ip` obj.

 * The PLIC should be largely compatible with the (currently draft) [RISC-V PLIC

 * addresses. We intend to make the addresses compatible with the PLIC
 * specification in the near future.
