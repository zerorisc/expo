    '''Return minimum and maximum instruction counts across control paths.

    In the presence of control-flow cycles or loops with a non-constant
    number of iterations, the maximum number of iterations will be
    None, because there's no clear maximum number of times the loop/cycle
    could run.

    The `stop_at` parameter indicates the expected end point of the control
    flow path(s) from this starting point. It is not currently supported for
    control flow paths from a single start point to have different endings --
    for instance, for one branch to end the program with `ecall` and another to
    return to the caller with `ret`. This is because, for instance, if this
    function is called recursively on a subroutine (stop_at = RET), then the
    caller needs to know the min/max instruction count *after the subroutine
    call returns*, and it would require substantial additional tracking to
    account for some additional, separate path that ends the program entirely.

    In all cases, the function will raise an error if it encounters one of the
    other stopping points; for instance, if an `ecall` instruction appears when
    `stop_at` = RET, then there will be an error. The function will return the
    min/max instruction counts across *all control-flow paths* from the given
    start point to the stopping point.
